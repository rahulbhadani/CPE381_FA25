\chapter{Submission and Grading Policy}

\section*{Grading}

As your instructor, I do not \textit{give} grades: I assign the grade that you earn, based on your individual performance. You will not be competing with other students for your grade for all assignments in this course: your grade is solely based on the points you earn, in the below-weighted
categories:

\begin{center} 
\begin{tabular}{lp{1in} l l l}
\textbf{Homework:} & 20\% \\
 \textbf{Quizzes:} &  5\%\\
\textbf{Attendance/In-Class Participation:} & 15\%\\
\textbf{Mid-term Exam 1:} & 15\%  \\
\textbf{Mid-term Exam 2:} & 15\%  \\
\textbf{Final Exam:} & 30\%  \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}


\begin{tabular}{|p{3cm}|p{3cm}|}
\hline
\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{\textbf{Grading Scale}} \\ \hline
\textbf{Percentage} & \textbf{Grade} \\ \hline
90\% - 100\% & A \\ \hline
75\% - 89\% & B \\ \hline
60\% - 74\% & C \\ \hline
45\% - 59\% & D \\ \hline
0\% - 44\% & F \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

The percent score will be rounded to the nearest integer before assigning the final grade.



\section*{Homework Submission Policy}
You must submit all of the code, data, and pdf files in a zip folder (i.e., not rar, 7z, etc) on Canvas. If the submission requires only a single file, it doesn't need to be zipped. Assignments must be submitted as a zip file with code and a pdf document with your solutions!  You must include a single PDF file (not doc, docx, or multiple JPEG figures of the pages from your homework) with the solutions. Failure to follow any/all of these policies leaves the instructor the option not to grade the homework based on a failure to follow the homework submission policy. Your zip and pdf should be named as follows \texttt{CPE381-LastFirst-HW-XX.zip} and \texttt{CPE381-LastFirst-HW-X.pdf}, where Last is your last name as it appears on Canvas, First is your first name as it appears on Canvas and X is the homework number. Example: \texttt{CPE381-TaylorSam-HW-01.zip}

\section{Missed Assignments/Make-Ups/Extra Credit}

Homework assignments that will submitted after the due date will receive a penalty of 10\% for each day, for a maximum of 5 days, after which no submission will be entertained. Solution to homework will posted 5 days after the due date.  Students are expected to start working on their assignments as soon as it is posted. Homework solutions will be posted within one week of their due date. There will not be extra credit assignments, however, individual homework may have bonus questions constituting not more than 10\% of the individual assignment.



\chapter{Attendance Policy}
All students are expected to arrive on time and attend lectures. If there are extenuating circumstances, please email the instructor. If you are absent, you are responsible for learning the material covered in class. If you are absent when an assignment is due, you must have submitted the assignment before the due date to receive credit. Please contact your instructor if you have specific questions or concerns. 

\section*{Attendance, Participation, and Quizzes:}
Attendance is mandatory. You are permitted a maximum of \textbf{two unexcused absences}. A daily roll will be taken.  Pop quizzes or class handouts may be distributed without notice; these \emph{cannot} be made up.  All in-class exercises serve as objective measures of participation and attendance; these activities \emph{cannot} be made up.  Anticipated absences for valid reasons (e.g., conference travel) \emph{must be cleared in advance} to avoid a participation penalty.

\chapter{Academic Integrity} 
Students are expected to do all work by themselves, except when specified by the instructor in writing. All exceptions will be plainly marked in the requirements for that exercise or project. Any violations of this policy will be dealt with to the full extent permitted by the University of Alabama in Huntsville, and \emph{may result in suspension or expulsion from the university, in addition to a failing grade}. Please familiarize yourself with the Code of Academic Integrity if you have any questions.

\section*{Class Disruptions:}
Please silence your cell phone, and do not use it during the class. The use of a phone in class will adversely affect your attendance grade\footnote{Uh, um, unless you are programming it as part of an in-class exercise. But please, no talking or texting. Unless, uh, that is part of the class exercise too.}.


\chapter{Communication \& Instructional Continuity}
In this class, the official mode of communication is through the email or Canvas. During the week, students can expect a response from the instructor within a 24-48 hour timeframe. Messages sent during the weekend may not be answered until the following week. On occasion, response times may vary due to domestic and international travel for conferences or meetings.

In the event a regularly scheduled course is unexpectedly interrupted, course requirements, due dates, and grading policy are subject to change when necessitated by revised course delivery, semester calendar, or other instances. Information about changes in this course can be obtained from the Canvas course webpage or by contacting me. If, under these circumstances, I do not respond within 72 hours, please contact my department at \href{mailto:ece@uah.edu}{ece@uah.edu}.

If our regular scheduled class meeting is interrupted or the campus should unexpectedly close, students should immediately log onto Canvas and read any course announcements. Students are encouraged to continue the readings and other assignments as outlined on the course syllabus until otherwise advised. Any student who does not study could fall behind in the course.


\chapter{Course Conduct}

All students must treat others with civility and respect and conduct themselves in a way that does not unreasonably interfere with the opportunity of other students to learn. All communication between student/instructor and between student/student should be respectful and professional. 


\chapter{Academic Honesty}
Your written assignments and examinations must be your own work. Academic misconduct will not be tolerated. Examples of unacceptable behavior include plagiarism/use of prior work/use of Chegg and other online problem-solving sites/etc. To ensure that you are aware of what academic misconduct is considered, you should carefully review the definitions and examples provided in \href{https://www.uah.edu/dos/office-of-student-ethics-education/handbook}{Student Handbook}. If you have questions in this regard, please contact me without delay.


\chapter{Course Artificial Intelligence (AI) Policy}

You are allowed to use a generative model-based AI tool for your assignment. However, you must submit an accompanied reflection report on how you used the AI tool, what the query was for the tool, and how it improved your understanding of the subject. You must also add your thoughts on how you would tackle the assignment if there was no such tool available. Failure to provide a reflection report for every single assignment where an  AI tool was used may result in a penalty, and subsequent actions will be taken in line with the plagiarism policy.

\chapter{Safety Instructions} 
The frequent operation of a computer, such as will be required in this course, may have long-term disabling effects if you do not appropriately consider your ergonomic interaction with the computer, desk, chair, and light sources. Poorly designed workstations/practices can lead to musculoskeletal disorders and may result in chronic pain, inability to sleep, or expensive surgery decades from today. The habits you form in your university years may well impact your future performance, and it is highly recommended that you consult with the office risk management and compliance \href{https://www.uah.edu/rmi}{https://www.uah.edu/rmi}.
